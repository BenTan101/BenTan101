### Hello, I'm I-Shiang.

I'm a final year student at NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, in Singapore.

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably listening to music, reading up on quirky organic chemistry reactions, watching French Youtube videos/films, eating cheese, or listening to music.

When I'm free ðŸ¥² I hope to learn more front-end development and also do more cool (generative?) AI stuff. Otherwise, I have worked on JavaFX apps, Android apps, Flutter web apps, some Vue stuff, some SQL stuff, as well as machine learning and data visualisation in Python and Julia.
