### Hello, I'm I-Shiang.

I'm still a high schooler studying at NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, in Singapore.

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably reading up on quirky organic chemistry reactions, watching French Youtube videos/films, or eating cheese.

When I'm free (which I'm often not ðŸ¥²), I hope to learn more front-end development. Otherwise, I have worked on Android apps, Flutter web apps, as well as machine learning and data visualisation with Python.
